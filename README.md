# Simplex Garmin Watchface

A simple customizable analog watchface for Garmin smartwatches.

All colors are customizable. Date, second hand, and numbers can be removed in the settings if wanted. 

The watch face includes by default a light and a dark theme. 

If you wish to apply the customized colors select "Custom" mode in the settings. The color of the second hand will be always the custom one specified in the settings, even in "Theme" mode.
